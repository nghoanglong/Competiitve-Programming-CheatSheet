## Codeforces - Solution
Thư mục này chứa solution của tất cả các bài mình đã giải ở Codeforces, chủ yếu là ở ProblemSet vì mình cũng ít khi sắp xếp được thời gian để tham gia mấy cái contest. Anyway nếu có bất cứ thắc mắc nào, feel free to contact me at [profile](https://nghoanglong.github.io/)

## Hướng dẫn

Để đỡ mất công scroll chuột tìm solution, sử dụng tổ hợp phím **Ctrl + F** để tìm solution cho bài mong muốn, có thể tìm bằng ID của bài đó(lấy trên ProblemSet) hoặc dùng tên của bài cần tìm là được.
